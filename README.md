    Yippee, finished up my JS final project yesterday, coincidentally around the time that a new module was added to that path. Fuck that for now, I'll come back later at some point probably.

    Also yippee, it's portfolio time. Now I get to make sure all of my past projects actually run on GH pages. I think most do overall, but most of the react apps will not, so that will take some doing. Still can't get over that I'm finally done with the JS final project. It's a lot of fun to play around with. It's also hard to compare to other final projects, since they're all so different. Regardless, I'm happy with it and happy to move on from it.

    For my portfolio, I wanted to do something a little different. It seems like the portfolio is used as a place to showcase cool animations, which I feel I'm pretty good at. The only difference is that a lot of these portfolio animations that I see people using are beyong what I've come up with, which is actually a good thing. Good artists borrow and great artists steal as they say. 

    The primary original idea I have is to have the whole site take place on some sort of beach. The user is experience their life flashing before their eyes, or more accurately my life flashing before their eyes, and my portfolio is a representation of those memories. In the waters along the beach are fish, each being an item from my portfolio. You can fish for them like a fishing minigame, or just look through them normally. I think the normal layout will be the default.

    First hiccup of the day was my restaurant page, which I knew would need fixing. Basically it just needed to import images the same way I do with react, so that it could properly be bundled. All good now. But it looks like I'll have to this same fix with all my non-react webpack shit.

    Steady progress, but I've literally spent four hours just fixing two projects so that I can acutually run them on GH pages.

    So in a lot of these older projects, I have images placed in the dist folder, which somehow wasn't an issue before, but now building the package basically deletes all of them. Thanks to Github it's not much of an issue, but I'm still not sure why this would have been working before.

    Went to the local fair yesterday. Lots of fun. Some sort of gas attack as well.

    Was able to wrap up hosting the rest of my sites properly in an hour. Feels good, having my sites actually accessible as web sites in the same form that I work on them. Also hashrouter is crazy crucial, and I'm not sure why it's never mentioned in the routing section of TOP. Or maybe it is, and I just forgot about it.

    Now to get working on the good stuff. I think most of the site will be not that complicated, so I can layout the basics and just get working on the portfolio pool.

    Fuck me, I've got a fish textured with a gif if my JS final project swimming around in a pool, and he points to where he's going. Which of course doesn't sound all that impressive, but it actually required using math from high school that I have long forgotten.
